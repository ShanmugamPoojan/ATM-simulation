A simple ATM simulation using Java Swings GUI.
All basic operations on a ATM like Withdraw, Deposit, Fast Cash, Change PIN, Balance can be performed. And even print the recipt(virtually).
No database is used to track the account details. It uses HashMap to store the account number and the balance temporarily.
